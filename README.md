## Goal

Create the cover of a newspaper (main page) trying not to copy any particular newspaper but to put together your own cover design using FlexBox as the main tool for creating a Responsive Design following the Mobile First concept.

## Comments

* I think the content was supposed to be in English, but not sure.
* The page looks like it was made on Paint (horrible style) but it's resposive I believe.
* I need to learn how use .png files so that they have a transarent background.
* Regarding the "Mobile First" concept, I think I did the oppsite here, wrote the code for pc and at the last part of the .css I added a Media Query with "max-width".
